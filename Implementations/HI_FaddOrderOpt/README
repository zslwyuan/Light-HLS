HI_FAddOrderOpt will try to transform the series of floating-point addition (e.g. A+A+A+A+A+B+B) into a parallelism-friendly IR code sequence

possible computation sequence:
stage0: a0 = A + A
stage1: a1 = A + a0;
stage2: a2 = A + a1;
stage3: a3 = A + a2;
stage4: o0 = a3 + B;
stage5: o1 = o0 + B

which is not parallelized and cannot take the advantage of FPGA

Then re-genenrate the floating-point addition to reduce computation dependence and maximize parallelism

stage0: a0 = A + A              a1 = A + A        b = B + B
stage1: a2 = a0 + a1;           c0 = A + b
stage2: c1 = a2 + c0

(a0 and a1 is duplicate, which will be removed by latter passes.)
